        <h2>What is Civil Engineering?</h2>
        <p>Civil Engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment. This includes works such as roads, bridges, dams, buildings, and other large-scale infrastructure projects. Civil engineers play a critical role in shaping the infrastructure that allows modern society to function.</p>

        <h2>Core Areas of Civil Engineering</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structural Engineering:</strong> Focuses on the design and analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, and other structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation Engineering:</strong> Involves the design and maintenance of transportation systems like roads, highways, railways, and airports.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Engineering:</strong> Deals with waste management, water and air pollution control, and sustainable infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Geotechnical Engineering:</strong> Studies the behavior of earth materials (soil, rock) for construction purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction Management:</strong> Manages construction projects, including cost estimation, scheduling, and safety.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Civil Engineering</h2>
        <p>Civil engineering is integral to numerous industries and fields. Some of its key applications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, and airports.</li>
            <li><strong>Urban Planning:</strong> Design of cities, residential, and commercial buildings.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Resources:</strong> Design and construction of dams, water treatment plants, and flood control systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Sustainable building design, waste management, and environmental impact assessments.</li>
            <li><strong>Disaster Management:</strong> Earthquake-resistant buildings, flood protection systems, and recovery from natural disasters.</li>
        </ul>
